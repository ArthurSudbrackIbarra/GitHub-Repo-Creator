# Contributing to GRC

Contributions are greatly appreciated! Feel free to contribute to GRC by opening pull requests with new features, improvements, bug fixes...

Make sure, however, to **follow the patterns** already being used in the source code, scripts and documentation.

You can either create a fork and open a PR from the forked repository or directly open a PR to the GRC repository.

Make sure to describe the changes you have made, commenting what they are introducing/solving and why.
